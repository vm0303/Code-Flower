                        <p> CodeFlower has offers programming topics selected to give you a basic idea of how computer
                            programming works. Once you select a Topic you are interested in you may work through lessons
                            and test your code in the browser so you can verify you what you have learned. Once you
                            are done with a lesson you will take a quiz to solidify your understanding and move to the
                            next lesson/topic.
